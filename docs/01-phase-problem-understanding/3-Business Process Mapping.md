# 📌 Business Process Mapping  

---

### 🔴 Current vs 🟢 Proposed Approach  

#### 1. Volunteer Onboarding  
- **Current:** Registration via paper forms / Excel, incomplete & scattered data.  
- **Proposed:** Online registration through portal, captures skills & availability, auto welcome email.  

#### 2. Event Coordination  
- **Current:** Communication via WhatsApp / email, often missed by volunteers.  
- **Proposed:** Events created in platform, real-time calendar view, automated SMS/email reminders.  

#### 3. Participation Tracking  
- **Current:** Volunteer hours not recorded, feedback informal/missing.  
- **Proposed:** Attendance & hours auto-recorded, personal impact reports shared.  

#### 4. Reporting & Insights  
- **Current:** Reports manually created in spreadsheets, limited visibility.  
- **Proposed:** Real-time dashboards, inactive volunteer detection, smart re-engagement suggestions.
