## 📌 Problem Statement

Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) heavily depend on volunteers to carry out their activities such as **blood donation camps, food drives, awareness campaigns, and fundraising events**.  

However, most NGOs still rely on **manual methods** (Excel sheets, phone calls, WhatsApp groups) to manage volunteers, which creates multiple challenges:

- **Inefficient Tracking:** Hard to maintain updated information about volunteer skills, availability, and past contributions.  
- **Low Engagement:** Without regular reminders, thank-you messages, or proper recognition, volunteers often lose motivation and drop out.  
- **Lack of Insights:** NGOs cannot easily measure volunteer impact (e.g., hours contributed, event participation, retention rate).  
- **Missed Opportunities:** Without data-driven insights, NGOs struggle to identify which volunteers to engage more actively and how to retain them.  
- **Integration Gaps:** Event scheduling, communications, and follow-ups often require switching between multiple tools (Google Calendar, emails, messaging apps).

There is a clear need for a **smart Salesforce-based platform** that goes beyond simple volunteer management and instead focuses on:

- ✅ **Engagement** – Personalized communication and recognition  
- ✅ **Automation** – Reduce manual effort through workflows and reminders
